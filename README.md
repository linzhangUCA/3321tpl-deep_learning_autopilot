# Final Project - Deep Learning Self-Driving

## Objectives
- Develop a deep learning autopilot model based on convolutional neural networks.
- Test the autopilot on the designated track.
   
## Requirements
- Design your autopilot model in [convnets.py](scripts/convnets.py). The model is suppose to take in color image with shape of `(176, 208, 3)` and output steering and throttle values with shape of `(1, 2)`. 
- Collect data to train your autopilot.
- Deploy and test the autopilot model.
